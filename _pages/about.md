I am currently a research fellow in Institute of Operations Research and Analytics at National University of Singapore, working with Professor <a href="https://blog.nus.edu.sg/mattohkc/" style="text-decoration: underline;"> Kim-Chuan Toh</a> and Professor <a href="https://subhro-ghosh.github.io/" style="text-decoration: underline;"> Subhroshekhar Ghosh</a>. Before that, I was a research fellow at Department of Mathematics, National University of Singapore, hosted by Professor <a href="https://blog.nus.edu.sg/mattohkc/" style="text-decoration: underline;"> Kim-Chuan Toh</a> and Professor <a href="https://subhro-ghosh.github.io/" style="text-decoration: underline;"> Subhroshekhar Ghosh</a>. I completed my Ph.D. in mathematics at National University of Singapore, where I was co-advised by Professor <a href="https://blog.nus.edu.sg/mattohkc/" style="text-decoration: underline;"> Kim-Chuan Toh</a> and Professor <a href="https://matzc.github.io/" style="text-decoration: underline;"> Chao Zhou</a>. Previously, I graduated from Nanjing University in 2016 with a B.S. in Information and Computing Science. 

This is my [[CV]({{ site.url }}/assets/pdf/LinMeixia_CV.pdf)].

Current research interests:
