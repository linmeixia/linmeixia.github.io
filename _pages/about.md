I am currently a research fellow in Institute of Operations Research and Analytics at National University of Singapore, working with Professor Kim-Chuan Toh and Professor Subhroshekhar Ghosh. Previously, I was a research fellow at Department of Mathematics, National University of Singapore, hosted by Professor Kim-Chuan Toh. I completed my Ph.D. in mathematics at National University of Singapore, where I was co-advised by Professor Kim-Chuan Toh and Professor Chao Zhou. Previously, I graduated from Nanjing University in 2016 with a B.S. in Information and Computing Science. This is my [[CV]({{ site.url }}/assets/pdf/LinMeixia_CV.pdf)]
