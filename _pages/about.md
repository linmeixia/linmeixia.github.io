I am currently an Assistant Professor in the Engineering Systems and Design Pillar at the Singapore University of Technology and Design. I received my Ph.D. in Optimization from National University of Singapore in 2020 under the supervision of Professors <a href="https://blog.nus.edu.sg/mattohkc/" style="text-decoration: underline;"> Kim-Chuan Toh</a> and <a href="https://matzc.github.io/" style="text-decoration: underline;"> Chao Zhou</a>. Prior to joining SUTD in summer 2022, I held Research Fellow positions in Department of Mathematics and Institute of Operations Research and Analytics at National University of Singapore, hosted by Professor <a href="https://blog.nus.edu.sg/mattohkc/" style="text-decoration: underline;"> Kim-Chuan Toh</a>. I obtained my B.S. in Information and Computing Science from Nanjing University.

This is my [[CV]({{ site.url }}/assets/pdf/CV_MeixiaLIN.pdf)]. <small>Updated in July 2024</small>
